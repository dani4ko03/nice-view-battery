### All You Need: nice!view Battery

I've spent time developing practical customization for the nice!view displays, focusing on what truly matters. No unnecessary features, no input lag - just a clean layout provides everything when you need it at a quick glance. Enjoy!

Add this shield to your keymap repo (see usage below) and run the GitHub action to build your firmware.

## Customization

My preference is to comment out the `display-name` for your base layer so it highlights changes only, keeping layout clean and visualy appealing. But the final decision on you.

## Usage

To use this shield, first add it to your `config/west.yml` by adding a new entry to remotes and projects:

```yml
manifest:
  remotes:
    - name: zmkfirmware
      url-base: https://github.com/zmkfirmware
    - name: infely                             # new entry
      url-base: https://github.com/infely      # new entry
  projects:
    - name: zmk
      remote: zmkfirmware
      revision: main
      import: app/west.yml
    - name: nice-view-battery                  # new entry
      remote: infely                           # new entry
      revision: main                           # new entry
  self:
    path: config
```

Now, simply swap out the default nice_view shield on the board for nice_view_battery in your `build.yaml` file.

```yml
---
include:
  - board: nice_nano_v2
    shield: corne_left nice_view_adapter nice_view_battery  # updated entry
  - board: nice_nano_v2
    shield: corne_right nice_view_adapter nice_view_battery # updated entry
```
